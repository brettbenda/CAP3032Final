Instruction Manual – How to Play our Game

Upon running our game, you will be at a start screen. From this screen, you can either 
select to read the rules of the game, or choose to start.

When start is chosen, you will be prompted to select a difficulty, 
Easy, Medium, or Hard. The difficulties will determine the size of the gameboard, 
Easy being 5x5, medium 7x7, and Hard 9x9. Then 

The goal of the game is to match the larger canvas to the smaller canvas’ pattern. 
This will result in a win. Using the arrow keys will shift all the tiles left, right, 
up, or down depending on the user input. All tiles will move in the direction prompted, 
unless blocked by the edge of the canvas or by the wall tiles (tiles which are black). 
It is a race against the clock, as you want to see how quickly you can match the canvas 
to the key. If lost, there are two buttons. One is an undo button, represented by an 
arrow key. This will undo your last move up to 5 times in a row. The other is a reset 
button, represented by a circle with a line through it. This will reset the canvas back 
to where it originally was at the start of the round (without changing the end goal, of 
course). Once the two canvases match, you will be prompted to a victory screen, 
displaying your time and allowing you to return to the main menu or play again. 

In order to run our game, open the "CAP3032" .pde file and it will open all attached
classes, as well as implement any audio or image files that we currently use.
